Ostensibly, these standards and the EU’s regulation are designed to protect consumer health and ensure fair food trade. However, a closer examination reveals that these regulations stifle alternative medicine, particularly naturopathy, and restrict legitimate discourse around the health benefits of natural substances.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why this regulation is doing more harm than good</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Scientific evidence vs. regulation</strong>. While the EU emphasises that health claims must be substantiated by scientific evidence, there is a growing body of research supporting the efficacy of foods, herbs, and micronutrients in promoting health and detoxification. Why are the regulators so reluctant to acknowledge this? Are they genuinely focused on consumer protection, or do they serve to uphold the interests of mainstream allopathic medicine, sidelining alternative approaches that have been historically used for centuries?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Marginalisation of alternative practices</strong>. The stringent criteria for health claims marginalise naturopathy and other alternative practices that don’t align with conventional medical paradigms. Practitioners who advocate for holistic and natural remedies are then often dismissed or regulated out of existence. The implications for public health are significant, as individuals seeking alternative care are increasingly left without options that could benefit their well-being.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Impact on free speech</strong>. By restricting the language used in health discussions, regulatory bodies may inadvertently suppress valuable information that could empower individuals to take charge of their health. This raises ethical concerns about who gets to decide what constitutes valid health discourse and what narratives are allowed in the public sphere.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Now ‘detox’ is fast disappearing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A year or so ago, it was still possible to visit your local supermarket or health shop and find products that described their function as ‘detox’ or ‘detoxification’. This is becoming increasingly difficult.<br><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2018-05-16/detox-tea-name-banned-for-failing-to-meet-regulations-for-health-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a><br></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2018-05-16/detox-tea-name-banned-for-failing-to-meet-regulations-for-health-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noreferrer noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1003\" src=\"https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/f9e26085-1974-4b70-8d1d-07c4a6ccbadf_1250x1224-1024x1003.webp\" alt=\"Pukka Herbs banned from naming one of their tea products &quot;Detox&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-143857\" style=\"width:632px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/f9e26085-1974-4b70-8d1d-07c4a6ccbadf_1250x1224-1024x1003.webp 1024w, https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/f9e26085-1974-4b70-8d1d-07c4a6ccbadf_1250x1224-300x294.webp 300w, https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/f9e26085-1974-4b70-8d1d-07c4a6ccbadf_1250x1224-768x752.webp 768w, https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/f9e26085-1974-4b70-8d1d-07c4a6ccbadf_1250x1224.webp 1250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, claims related to detoxification have generally received unfavourable assessments from the European Food Standards Agency (EFSA), so they have not been authorised for use on food products. EU citizens or businesses using ‘detox’ in marketing or labelling could face legal consequences if they do not comply. This is particularly relevant for businesses that market dietary supplements or food products claiming detox benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The inability to discuss detoxification obstructs informed patient choice and undermines the potential benefits of natural health practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What this means for health-promoting medicine</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This regulation has led to business closures and court cases. Companies can incur significant fines for so-called misleading advertising or non-compliance with health claims regulations. If a product is deemed in violation of “health claims”, authorities may mandate a recall, which can be very costly. Companies face lawsuits from consumers or regulatory bodies, bringing more financial liabilities and potential damages. In severe cases, companies can be forced to shut down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why don’t companies just get their products registered under the EU Health Claim Act? Cost is a huge factor. The costs can range from 20,000 to over 140,0000 euros with additional annual costs of 1,000-5,000 euros. But if you can’t get an apple, time in a sauna, dandelion, zeolite, or chlorella patented, who would spend this amount on top of expensive and time-consuming studies?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"855\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Child-eating-apple.png\" alt=\"Child eating apple\" class=\"wp-image-143864\" style=\"width:641px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Child-eating-apple.png 855w, https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Child-eating-apple-300x168.png 300w, https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Child-eating-apple-768x431.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 855px) 100vw, 855px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It’s not healthy until they say it is</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember the phrase: “an apple a day keeps the doctor away”? In the EU, claiming that &#8220;an apple is healthy&#8221; is no longer straightforward. Such a claim must be specific and backed by so-called robust scientific evidence, demonstrating clear links between the food and each health benefit. Moreover, any health claim requires pre-approval from the EFSA. Without this rigorous evaluation, such claims cannot legally be used in marketing or labeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So despite scientific evidence that apples are healthy due to their rich nutrient profile &#8211; which includes dietary fiber, vitamins (especially vitamin C) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-3-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">various antioxidants</a> &#8211; and help reduce chronic disease risk and improve heart and digestive health, it is a crime in Europe to say so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Codex Alimentarius and the EU Health Claims regulation may aim to protect consumers, but they’re actually protecting dominant medical narratives by censoring alternative medicine and removing informed choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Back to the word ‘detox’.</strong> The need to clear our bodies of toxins has never been greater &#8211; and yet apparently, we mustn’t speak freely about it.
