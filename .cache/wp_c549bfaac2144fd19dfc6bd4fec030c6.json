This move comes amid ongoing debates about the WHO&#8217;s role in managing global health crises, financial transparency, and influence on national sovereignty.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br><strong>Introduction to World Council for Health</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021,the World Council for Health (WCH) emerged as a prominent organization that challenges the WHO&#8217;s pervasive and damaging influence. The WCH is a coalition of independent health organizations, medical professionals, and advocacy groups that emphasizes a more decentralized, holistic, and patient-centered approach to health care. It advocates for local health sovereignty, individual choice, and the decentralization of power away from large international organizations like the WHO. The WCH has been particularly vocal about opposing what it sees as the WHO&#8217;s overreach, particularly in terms of its management of public health policies during crises like the COVID-19 chapter, while  ignoring real health issues like heart health, cancer, diabetes, and mental health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A better way forward for health, rooted in our Better Way Principles, would focus on strengthening local and national health systems, ensuring that decision-making is transparent, accountable, and driven by scientific evidence rather than political or financial interests. This approach would involve greater collaboration between governments, health professionals, and communities, rather than relying on a centralized body like the WHO to dictate policy internationally. By prioritizing national sovereignty, autonomy, and local expertise, a more resilient and responsive international health framework can be developed, one that respects individual freedoms and prioritizes people over institutional power.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br><strong>A. Concerns about WHO’s monopoly through Collaborating Centres</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our extensive research has revealed WHO collaborating centres in the US, including the CDC and the NIH. As a matter of urgency and priority, to effectively exit the World Health Organization, it is essential to have both critical awareness and transparent knowledge of the arguably binding agreements made between the secretive USA WHO Collaborating Centres and USA GOARN Partner Institutions, with the World Health Organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To truly exit the WHO, we must acknowledge the vast network and reach of the designated WHO Collaborating Centres and GOARN Partner Institutions. We must investigate the potential conflicts of interest in public &#8211; private collaborations / collaborations that may exist, which affect the delivery of the ultimate healthcare available for the people and the planet</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>World Council for Health calls for an Urgent Independent International Review / Investigation of the World Health Organization and its established collaborations and ‘binding’ agreements with WHO Collaborating Centres. This is an essential requirement to assess an honest and transparent benefit and risk of WHO policies being utilised in and against sovereign nations through these established WHO networks. WCH is ready to advise.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br><strong>B. WCH Country Councils leading the way for health freedom</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WCH has established over 30 and growing independent Country Councils around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These Country Councils are linked to over 200 local advocacy organisations in the fields pertinent to health, including medical choice and rights, 5G, sexual engineering, food supplies, agribusiness and climate ‘change’, all of which are tools being used by shadowy globalist corporations to usurp rights and freedoms of people around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These Country Councils and allied grass-roots organisations are a critical counterbalance to the WHO and its puppeteers, advocating for a new, human and planetary wellbeing-focused vision for health care, prioritising the well-being and human rights of men, women and children. Country Councils are driven by ethical individuals, standing together to create the new healthcare paradigm, rooted in transparency and autonomy. This by definition includes freedom and sovereignty. Our country councils recognise that peace is central to health.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br><strong>C. Our Legal Briefs and Policy Briefs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The WCH published a groundbreaking Legal Brief on Preventing the Abuse of Public Health Emergencies. It explains how governments used the declaration of an unjustifiable state of emergency as a legal instrument to deny people their basic human rights and freedoms and grant themselves extraordinary powers. WCH also published comprehensive policy briefs on Rejecting Monopoly Power Over Global Public Health, as well as Effects of Unregulated Digitalization on Health and Democracy, and Human Trafficking: A Call for Action</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Our Resources Include</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Legal and Policy Briefs: <a href=\"https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/policy-briefs/\">https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/policy-briefs/</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Country Councils: <a href=\"https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/country-councils/\">https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/country-councils/</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exit The WHO materials: <a href=\"https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/exit-the-who/\">https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/exit-the-who/</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>WHO Collaborating Centres: <a href=\"https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/world-council-for-health-uncovers-who-collaborating-centres-worldwide/\">https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/world-council-for-health-uncovers-who-collaborating-centres-worldwide/</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br><strong>Cooperation is the key to achieving shared goals</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The WCH recognises the intention of the US government to withdraw from the WHO, urges investigation into the WHO’s collaborating centres, and is open to engage around the work of our country councils, our legal and policy briefs, and our pioneering detox study and guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><br></strong><strong>World Council for Health</strong></p>\n","date":"2025-01-21T15:11:23","excerpt":"<p>The recent decision of the United States government to announce an intended withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) marks a significant shift in international relations and health policy.
