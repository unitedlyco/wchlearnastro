The results are shown as amounts per millilitre of blood. For any result showing more than 1000 ml, a detox is recommended.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"750\" height=\"525\" src=\"https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Understanding-your-results-blood-testing.png\" alt=\"Understanding your results - blood testing\" class=\"wp-image-143911\" style=\"width:492px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Understanding-your-results-blood-testing.png 750w, https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Understanding-your-results-blood-testing-300x210.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I thought lots of antibodies were a good thing? Why should I detox if I have more than 1000 units/ml in my blood?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A detox may be needed to help restore balance and remove any leftover immune materials, like antibodies or cellular waste that have accumulated in response the either a Covid infection, shedding or an injection. This would also help prevent your immune system becoming stressed or overloaded. Persistent immune responses (such as high antibody levels) can be linked to chronic inflammation in the body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does the <strong>Covid-19 Antibody test</strong> work?</strong><br><br>The test will arrive in the post; it is a simple finger prick blood test. Simply carry out the test, seal and return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:8px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"705\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Covid-Antibody-Testing-Key-Information-4-1.png\" alt=\"Covid Antibody Testing Key Information\" class=\"wp-image-143918\" style=\"width:504px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Covid-Antibody-Testing-Key-Information-4-1.png 705w, https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Covid-Antibody-Testing-Key-Information-4-1-212x300.png 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How To Test for <strong>Covid-19 Antibod</strong></strong>ies</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Get Your <strong>Covid-19 Antibody Test</strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Click the appropriate button below to get your Covid-19 antibody testing kit</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://medichecks.sjv.io/DybJxy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>UK</strong> Testing Kit &#8211; Medichecks</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://labcorp.sjv.io/dO9EzQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>USA</strong> Testing Kit &#8211; LabCorp</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:34px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"705\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/covid-Antibody-Testing-Key-Information-4.png\" alt=\"Covid Antibody Testing Key Information \" class=\"wp-image-143882\" style=\"width:491px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/covid-Antibody-Testing-Key-Information-4.png 705w, https://www.worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/covid-Antibody-Testing-Key-Information-4-212x300.png 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Other Considerations</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Data Concerns</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data privacy is a common concern and a valid consideration. Currently labs are the most accurate option despite concerns. With this in mind, WCH recommends emailing the lab to request that your data be removed and destroyed after results are provided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alternative Tests</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WCH has researched many labs/test providers. While we would prefer to recommend an independent lab/tester, there are currently very few places offering this service and private tests are often expensive and may not be accessible to all. Quick action via affordable lab tests is therefore recommended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If any independent labs become known to us, we will amend this page accordingly.
