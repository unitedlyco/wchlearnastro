We are surprised at this action and express our unwavering support for Prof. Dr. Yildaran, who has made significant contributions to child health and immunology with his pioneering research.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Unjust Closure of a Vital Laboratory</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pediatric Immunology and Allergy Diagnostic and Testing Laboratory, founded by Prof. Dr. Yildiran in 2011, is an indispensable institution for the diagnosis, research and treatment of childhood diseases in the Black Sea region of Turkey. It has provided invaluable services, including advanced immunological tests and diagnostics for diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma, and provided significant financial benefits to the university.<br><br>The sudden and unjust closure of this vital laboratory, allegedly organized by OMU Faculty of Medicine Chief Prof. Dr. Ünsal Özgen with the approval of the newly appointed Rector Prof. Dr. Fatma Aydın, raises serious concerns about academic freedom and the protection of scientific research. It is a worrying action aimed at suppressing critical research on vaccine safety and other pediatric immunology topics; areas in which Prof. Dr. Yildiran is a leader.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Vaccines and Immunocompomised patients</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prof. Dr. Alişan Yıldıran engaged in research concerning vaccines, particularly focusing on their implications for immunocompromised patients. Notably, he <a href=\"https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749%2814%2900293-0/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">co-authored a study</a> titled &#8220;<em>BCG vaccination in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency: complications, risks, and vaccination policies</em>,&#8221; which examines the adverse effects and risks associated with administering the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine to patients diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency or SCID . This research highlights the potential complications of BCG vaccination in individuals with SCID. It is critical to highlight the need for careful consideration of vaccination policies in general for <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/5/800\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">immunocompromised people</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Threat to Child Health and</strong> <strong>Scientific Integrity</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prof. Dr. Yildaran has long been a vocal advocate of therapeutic medicine and has made extensive contributions to advancing the understanding of diseases that affect children. His work in the fields of immunology and allergy, in particular, has been instrumental in developing accurate diagnoses and effective treatments for children in Turkey and beyond. The closure of his laboratory not only undermines his work over the years, but also jeopardizes the progress that has been made in the field of children’s health.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Call to Action Around The World</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We call on everyone to stand with Prof Yildiran and demand the immediate restoration of his laboratory. The measures taken against Prof. Dr. Yildiran are part of a trend to suppress vital scientific research, and we must take action to protect the rights of scientists and medical professionals to freely conduct their work without fear of reprisal. We call on individuals and organizations who value child welfare and the protection of&nbsp; freedom to speak out in support of ethical science not corrupted by conflicts of interest. Together, we can ensure that this important work continues to benefit future generations of children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","date":"2025-01-22T15:35:32","excerpt":"<p>World Health Council stands in solidarity with our valued member Prof. Dr. Alişan Yildaran of WCH Turkiye, due to the unjust closure of the Pediatric Immunology and Allergy Diagnostic and Testing Laboratory at Ondokuz Mayıs University (OMU).
