During that year,&nbsp;USAID distributed $72 billion. The largest distribution of aid, $16 billion, went to… Ukraine.

Read Tenpenny Report guest author&nbsp;<a href=\"https://substack.com/home/post/p-156541119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jon Fleetwood’s comprehensive (and sickening) analysis</a>&nbsp;of how USAID funded a long list of globalist entities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are bad, but it gets much worse. USAID&nbsp;funds were used for&nbsp;<strong>gain-of-function</strong>&nbsp;research that unleashed weaponized COVID-19 on the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2024 at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) grilled&nbsp;USAID Administrator Samantha Power over gain-of-function research. You can read the full transcript&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2024/04/11/rand_paul_vs_usaids_samantha_power_why_cant_we_admit_usaid_funded_gain-of-function_research.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>. Power had stated a year earlier (April 2023) that&nbsp;USAID <em><strong>did not</strong></em>&nbsp;fund this type of research. Sen. Paul gave her a chance to correct the record, but she doubled down, and continued to deny it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sen. Paul, who is also a physician, cited a 2015 journal article produced by the Wuhan Institute of Virology and Dr. Ralph Baric from University of North Carolina that thanked&nbsp;USAID for funding EcoHealth Alliance thorough&nbsp;<a href=\"https://p2.predict.global/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Project Predict</a>. The paper describe how the SARS virus was used as the “backbone” of the manufactured bioweapon. It was combined with an S protein from an unknown virus found in the wild. Senator Paul even quoted the comments from the authors of the 2015 paper:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“On the basis of these findings, scientific review panels may deem similar studies&nbsp;<strong>building chimeric viruses</strong>&nbsp;based on circulating strains too risky to pursue.” Even the authors admitted it was gain-of-function technology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The research was funded by USAID, where funds were passed to EcoHealth Alliance through USAID’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://p2.predict.global/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Project Predict.</a>&nbsp;Started in 2009, the program was adopted in 30 countries supposedly to “stop pandemics caused by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/zoonoses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">zoonotic diseases</a>,” and “to prevent the spread of disease from animals to humans.” In order to do this, scientists had to first create pathogenic particles in the lab that would infect humans.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gain-of-Function Research Expanded</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More details can by found by reading Pasheen Stonebrooke’s detailed post&nbsp;<a href=\"https://substack.com/home/post/p-156477958\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>. Core partners in Project Predict were certainly&nbsp;USAID and EcoHealth Alliance, but also Metabiota (the company Hunter Biden was involved in.) Another project, called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drasticresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/main-document-preempt-volume-1-no-ess-hr00118s0017-ecohealth-alliance.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Project DEFUSE,&nbsp;</a>proposed by DARPA, requested $14,209,245&nbsp;<em>(how do they come up with these numbers?)&nbsp;</em>over three years to study and sequence spike proteins found in Southeast Asian bats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plan was to reverse engineer the bat’s spike proteins and inject them into humanized mice to assess the capacity of bat SARS-CoV to cause disease. They would then create a prototype to assess the “likelihood of bats harboring dangerous viral pahoenes across Asia.” Project DEFUSE was briefed to 15 agencies, and one of them was&nbsp;USAID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work was to be subcontracted to Ralph Baric’s group in North Carolina and several other organizations including the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, and the Palo Alto Research Center, tasked with “the development of novel delivery automated aerosolization mechanisms.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Major Joseph Murphy, a U.S. Marine Corps officer, who worked at DARPA became a whistleblower regarding Project DEFUSE.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>In July 2021, Major Murphy discovered that the unclassified grant proposal for the project had been uploaded to a classified portal. The proposal had been submitted by EcoHealth Alliance in May 2018 and outlined specific plans to engineer a coronavirus with characteristics similar to SARS-CoV-2. Because it was listed in the classified portal, the proposal was hidden and excluded from the Office of Director of National Intelligence&#8217;s (ODNI) final August 2021 report on the virus&#8217;s origins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Even before Rand Paul’s 2024 hearings, US Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-Kansas) had demanded in 2022 that&nbsp;USAID cease funding EcoHealth Alliance because it had violated grant requirements and had failed to disclose COVID-19 research at the Wuhan lab. Marshall noted&nbsp;USAID&#8217;s incredible&nbsp;<em><strong>unwillingness to cooperate</strong></em>&nbsp;with congressional requests for information. Since that time, Peter Daszak, the lawyer who represented the organization, has been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vaxxter.com/tt-daszak-gets-his-due/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">formally debarred</a>&nbsp;for his role in this debacle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marshall and other senators also warned about the “dangerous lack of U.S. government oversight” over illegal foreign gain-of-function research. We wrote about that recently and you can read it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vaxxter.com/trump-puts-nih-on-notice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did&nbsp;USAID protect the public interest by immediately suspending financial grants and awards to EcoHealth? No, they did not even though they were told to do so. Sen. Marshall covers it all in great detail on his Senate website,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.marshall.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-marshall-leads-effort-demanding-usaid-ceases-ecohealth-alliance-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Press Room</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Tip of the Iceberg</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>President Donald Trump confirmed on Feb. 6 that&nbsp;USAID has stolen billions and billions and BILLIONS of dollars from American taxpayers, calling it “the biggest scandal of them all, perhaps the biggest in history.”&nbsp;USAID&#8217;s “gift-giving bonanza”&nbsp;<em>(dare we say money laundering operation?)</em>&nbsp;is enormous but it is merely the tip of the iceberg. Next on the audit list are NGO funding, the CDC and the mother of all black holes, the Department of Defense. Then the fireworks will REALLY begin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democrats are running scared. They can run, but they can’t hide from this one. As Trump says, it is “too big, too dirty.” And it has been going on for a long, long time. This screenshot only contains the first 15 countries, but holy cow. $17B to Ukraine? $3B to Israel? $733M to Yemen?&nbsp;<strong>And this was for only one year: 2023.</strong>&nbsp;To see the full list of 176 countries we gave money to in that year and the amounts&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/countries-that-receive-the-most-foreign-aid-from-the-u-s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">go here.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revealing this financial bleeding and following the rabbit trails to specific organizations, and perhaps&nbsp;<em><strong>to the pockets of specific people</strong></em>, is going to permanently damage many members of the Uniparty and all the bureaucrats who have been involved. This is why members of Congress are screaming about the exposure and pulling out all assaults on Trump and DOGE to get it to stop. The louder they scream, the more guilty they look. Afterall, who wouldn’t want to stop this insane waste of taxpayer money that contributes to our $37,000,000,000,000 ($37T) debt burden?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Government Waste &nbsp;&#8211; This is only a sample:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This list is long, but worth your time to peruse. It is disgusting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The massive promotion of homosexuality and the Green Agenda worldwide is actually more than disgusting. No wonder the world looks at our country as an amoral perpetrator and predator. Knowledge is power. I hope it inspires you to get involved with politics, demanding answers and changes from your Senators and Representatives to CHANGE THIS financial bloodletting coming from YOUR pocketbook. Just think what your community could do with a teeny, tiny fraction of this money. Think about the great things YOU could do with 0.00001% of this money for your local organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Believe it or not, this is an ABBREVIATED list of items Funded by&nbsp;USAID &amp; the State Department &nbsp;(only 5 of the 10 pages they have put together&nbsp;<em><strong>so far</strong></em>).
